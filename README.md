# CEC-PLS-SEM

## Description

This repository includes the implementation of Cardinality and Equality Constrained Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (CEC-PLS-SEM), a new approach aiming to tackle the issue of weight instability of PLS-SEM under high-dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) settings. The simulation study compares the performance of the new approach to Sparse Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis (SGCCA). The repository contains the functions developed in R to implement the method and the code for the simulation study.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised into two main folders:

-   Scripts/: Contains the R scripts for data generation and the functions required to run both methods.

    -   Psparse_Data.R : Script to obtain data with sparse factor loadings.

    -   Wsparse_Data.R : Script to obtain data with sparse weights.

    -   CEC_PLS_SEM_Functions.R : Functions for the CEC-PLS-SEM method.

    -   SGCCA_Function.R : Functions for the SGCCA method

-   Demo/ : Provides the scripts to run the method for the datasets and summarises the results for the methods.

    -   CEC_PLS_SEM.R : Script to run CEC-PLS-SEM and summarises results by averaging across 5 iterations per condition. Change the path to the data folder to obtain results under both data generation schemes.

    -   SGCCA.R : Script to run SGCCA and summarise results by averaging across 5 iterations per condition.

## How to Run This Project

-   **Step 1:** Clone the repository

-   **Step 2:** Generate the data by running Scripts/Psparse_Data.R and Scripts/Wsparse_Data.R

-   **Step 3:** Move to the demo folder and run the scripts CEC_PLS_SEM.R and SGCCA.R. Change the data directory in the files to run the scripts for both data generation schemes.
